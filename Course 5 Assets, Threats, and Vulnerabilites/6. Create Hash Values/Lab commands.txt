Activity overview
As a security analyst, you’ll need to implement security controls to protect organizations against a range of threats.

That’s where hashing comes in. Previously, you learned that a hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted. Hash functions are used to uniquely identify the contents of a file so that you can check whether it has been modified. This code provides a unique identifier known as a hash value or digest.

For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk.

Many tools are available to compare hashes for various scenarios. But for a security analyst it’s important to know how to manually compare hashes.

In this lab activity, we’ll create hash values for two files and use Linux commands to manually examine the differences.

Scenario
In this scenario, we need to investigate whether two files are identical or different.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you’ll display the contents of two files and create hashes for each file. Next, you’ll examine the hashes and compare them.

Let’s hash some files!

Lab Commands:

cat file1.txt

cat file2.txt

sha256sum file1.txt

sha256sum file2.txt 

sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash

sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash

cat file1hash

cat file2hash

cmp file1hash file2hash
