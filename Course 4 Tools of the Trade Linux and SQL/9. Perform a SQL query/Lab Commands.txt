Activity overview
Previously, you learned how to use basic SQL queries to retrieve information from a database. You have also learned about using the ORDER BY keyword to sort data returned in an ascending or a descending order.

In this lab activity, you’ll use SELECT and FROM in SQL to return the information you need from a database. You’ll also use the ORDER BY keyword to sequence the information returned by a query based on a specified column.

It's important to know how to query information from a database because this is a common task you might encounter as a security analyst. You should know how to get the information you need to improve security and keep data safe.

With that in mind, it's time to explore the scenario.

Note: The terms row and record are used interchangeably in this lab activity.
Scenario
In this scenario, you have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.

The information you need is located in the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll obtain information on the employee devices that must be updated. Next, you’ll examine the login attempts for unusual activity. Finally, you’ll use the ORDER BY keyword to sort the data returned by your SQL queries.

OK, let’s get ready to practice running your very first SQL queries!




Lab Commands:

SELECT *
FROM machines;

SELECT device_id, email_client FROM machines;

SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;

SELECT event_id, country FROM log_in_attempts;

SELECT username, login_date, login_time FROM log_in_attempts;

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date;

SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;
