Activity overview
As a security analyst, knowing how to make better queries to retrieve specific pieces of data can help you find the security-related information you need more efficiently.

In this lab activity, you’ll apply basic filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a MariaDB database.

MariaDB is a popular open source relational database that is compatible with MySQL.

This activity provides you with a great opportunity to apply what you’ve learned and add filters to SQL queries.

Note: The terms row and record are used interchangeably in this lab activity.
Scenario
In this scenario, you need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. Your team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.

You are responsible for finding the required information by querying a database. You’ll add filters to your queries to locate the information more quickly.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll list all organization machines and their operating systems. Second, you’ll list all machines with the operating system OS 2. Third, you’ll list all the employees in the Finance and Sales departments. Fourth, you’ll obtain information about machines.

You’re ready to add filters to SQL queries.

Lab Commands:
SELECT device_id, operating_system 
FROM machines;

SELECT device_id, operating_system 
FROM machines 
WHERE operating_system = 'OS 2';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE office = 'South-109';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE office LIKE 'South%';
