Activity overview
Previously, you learned about tools that you can use to filter information in Linux. You’re also familiar with the basic commands to navigate the Linux file system by now.

In this lab activity, you’ll use the grep command and piping to search for files and to return specific information from files.

As a security analyst, it’s key to know how to find the information you need. The ability to search for specific strings can help you locate what you need more efficiently.

Scenario
In this scenario, you need to obtain information contained in server log and user data files. You also need to find files with specific names.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and return the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. Next, you’ll navigate to the users directory and search for files that contain a specific string in their names. Finally, you’ll search for information contained in user files.
