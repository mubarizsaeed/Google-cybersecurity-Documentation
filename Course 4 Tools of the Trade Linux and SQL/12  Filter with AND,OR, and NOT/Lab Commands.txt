Activity overview
As a security analyst, you’ll likely need to analyze data. And often finding the specific data you’ll need depends on more than one factor.

To retrieve specific pieces of information from the database, you can filter for multiple conditions. You can also filter for what does not match a particular condition.

In this lab activity, you’ll use the AND, OR, and NOT operators to create more complex filters for SQL queries.

Get ready to practice running a few complex SQL queries!

Scenario
In this scenario, you need to obtain specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they belong to from the database.

Your team needs data to investigate potential security issues and to update computers.

You are responsible for filtering the required information from the database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve all failed login attempts after business hours. Second, you’ll retrieve all login attempts that occurred on specific dates. Third, you’ll retrieve logins that didn't originate in Mexico. Fourth, you’ll retrieve information about certain employees in the Marketing department. Fifth, you’ll retrieve information about employees in the Finance or the Sales department. Finally, you’ll obtain information about employees who are not in the Information Technology department.


Lab Commands:
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;

SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';

SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';
