Activity overview
In this lab activity, you’ll use Linux commands to modify a directory structure and the files it contains.

You’ll also use the nano text editor to add text to a file.

You previously learned that directories help you organize subdirectories and files in Linux. As a security analyst, creating, removing, and editing directories and files are core tasks you’ll need to perform to help you to manage data.

When data is well organized, you can more easily detect issues and keep data safe.

With that in mind, you’re now ready to practice what you've learned.

Scenario
In this scenario, you need to ensure that the /home/analyst directory is properly organized.

You have to make a few changes to the /home/analyst directory and the files it contains.

You also have to edit a file to record the changes or updates you make to the directory.

Note: The lab starts with your user account, called analyst, already logged in to a Bash shell. This means you can start with the tasks as soon as you click the Start Lab button.
When you start, the /home/analyst directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

home
└── analyst
    ├── notes
    │   ├── Q3patches.txt
    │   └── tempnotes.txt
    ├── reports
    │   ├── Q1patches.txt
    │   └── Q2patches.txt
    └── temp
You need to modify the /home/analyst directory to the following directory and file structure:

home
└── analyst
    ├── logs
    ├── notes
    │   └── tasks.txt    
    └── reports
        ├── Q1patches.txt
        └── Q2patches.txt
        └── Q3patches.txt
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll create a new subdirectory called logs in the /home/analyst directory. Next, you’ll remove the temp subdirectory. Then, you’ll move the Q3patches.txt file to the reports subdirectory and delete the tempnotes.txt file. Finally, you’ll create a new .txt file called tasks in the notes subdirectory and add a note to the file describing the tasks you've performed.

You’ll need to use the commands learned in the video lesson to complete these steps.

This might sound like quite a number of tasks to perform, but you’ll be guided on how to do this.


Commands:

mkdir logs
cd /home/analyst
rmdir temp
ls
cd /home/analyst/notes
mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports
ls /home/analyst/reports
cd /home/analyst/notes
rm tempnotes.txt
ls
touch tasks.txt
ls
nano task.txt
