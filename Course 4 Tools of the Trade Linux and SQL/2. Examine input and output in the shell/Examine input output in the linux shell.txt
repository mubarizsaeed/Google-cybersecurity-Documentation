Previously, you discussed how the Bash shell helps you communicate with a computer’s operating system.

When you communicate with the shell, the commands in the shell can take input and return output or error messages.

In this lab activity, you’ll use the echo command to examine how input is received and how output is returned in the shell. Next, you’ll use the expr command to further explore input and output while performing some basic calculations in the shell.

This activity will build foundations in understanding how you communicate with the Linux operating system through the shell. As a security analyst, you'll need to input commands into the shell and recognize when the shell returns either output or an error message.

Next, you'll explore the scenario!

Scenario
As a security professional, it’s important to understand the concept of communicating with your computer via the shell.

In this scenario, you have to input a specified string of text that you want the shell to return as output. You'll also need to input a few mathematical calculations so the OS (operating system) can return the result.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll use the echo command to generate some output in the shell. Second, you’ll use the expr command to perform basic mathematical calculations. Next, you’ll use the clear command to clear the Bash shell window. Finally, you’ll have an opportunity to explore the echo and expr commands further.

Get ready to examine input and output in the Bash shell!
